# POODR-notes
My notes on Sandi Metz's Practical OOD in Ruby book

#Intro
Design is important because all code is extremely likely to need modifications - because technology is changing, and because client needs are changing too. This is why OOD is so important, it makes modifying and extending code far easier - more cost-efficient, and also more pleasant to change. OOD implies seeing the world as objects that send each other messages.

#Chapter 1
OOD tries to manage dependencies, ensuring objects know as little as possible about each other, once again to facilitate change.
SOLID - studies have proven the usefulness of these principles.
Design Patterns are "simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in OO software design that make one's design more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable". They can be a near-perfect open-source solution for the problem they solve, but must be applied to the right problems.
